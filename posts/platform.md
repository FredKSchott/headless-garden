I couldn't possibly take on another project, but it would be so cool if someone turned this idea into a platform.

Twitter, but just for devs. Login with GitHub. Share code snippets. Embed live demos. And the rest of the Twitter-y things.

Of course, I already went domain huntingâ€”the perfect one is just sitting there, but I'm not dropping that kind of money unless I actually build the thing first. That's what we call progress. ðŸ«
